📱 Daily Fetal Movement Tracker (DFM)

A React Native (Expo) mobile application that helps pregnant users track daily fetal movements by measuring the time taken to feel 10 fetal kicks.
This app works completely offline, stores data locally, and focuses on calm, user-friendly health UX.

This project was developed as part of the React Native Developer Internship Assignment – ONI Care.

Build type: APK
Workflow: Managed
Keystore: Expo Managed

📦 The generated APK is included separately in the submission or shared via download link.


🧠 Data Storage Design

All tracking sessions are stored locally using AsyncStorage.

Data Structure
{
  id: string,
  date: string,
  duration: string,
  createdAt: number
}

Stored under a single storage key
Sessions are prepended so latest appears first
Serialized and parsed safely


🧭 App Flow (Execution)

User opens the app → Home Screen
Taps Record fetal movement
Counter screen opens
User taps START when ready
Timer runs until user taps STOP
User taps Save
Session is saved locally
User returns to Home Screen
Saved record appears under Past records


🧩 Design & UX Decisions

Start button added intentionally
Although the Figma reference shows an active timer, a manual START button was added to:
Give users control
Reduce anxiety
Improve usability in a health-sensitive context
Offline-first design
No backend was required per assignment instructions
Ensures reliability and privacy
Visual hierarchy
Larger timer area
Prominent actions
Reduced empty space
Balanced top-to-bottom layout


🎥 Screen Recording

A short screen recording (30–60 seconds) demonstrates:
App launch
Home screen
Recording a session
Saving data
Viewing past records
Info and Help modals


🧪 Tested On

📌 Assignment Notes

Figma was used as a design reference
Pixel-perfect replication was not the goal

Focus was on:
Functionality
Data persistence
UX reasoning
Code clarity
